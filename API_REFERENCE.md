# SpecForge API Reference

## Authentication

**Local development:** No authentication required. Session defaults to the first workspace.

**Pilot deployment:** Requests must include a valid GitHub OAuth session cookie from `/api/auth/login`. Access is enforced at the workspace level; a request can only access documents and jobs in workspaces the authenticated user is a member of.

**Service mode:** External agents can submit spec jobs using the service API. In local dev, no auth is required. In production, agents use workspace-scoped API keys or OAuth tokens.

## Service API — `/api/service/spec-jobs`

### POST /api/service/spec-jobs

Submit a brief and create a new spec job. Returns immediately with job status and document ID.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "brief": "A real-time collaborative spec editor",
  "mode": "assisted",
  "constraints": {
    "framework": "Next.js",
    "language": "TypeScript"
  },
  "workspaceId": "ws_123"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `brief` (string, required): Rough description of the software to be specified (1–5000 chars)
- `mode` (string, optional, default: `"assisted"`): Either `"assisted"` (job waits for human patch review) or `"autonomous"` (SpecForge runs the full spec loop unattended)
- `constraints` (object, optional): Key-value pairs passed to the spec generation agent
- `workspaceId` (string, optional): Target workspace ID. Defaults to the session's active workspace.

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "job": {
    "job_id": "sj_abc123",
    "workspace_id": "ws_123",
    "document_id": "doc_def456",
    "mode": "assisted",
    "status": "queued",
    "brief": "A real-time collaborative spec editor",
    "constraints": {},
    "created_at": "2025-02-01T12:34:56Z",
    "retry_count": 0
  },
  "document_id": "doc_def456",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Job statuses:**
- `queued` — Job created, awaiting processing (assisted mode) or human review
- `running` — Active spec generation pass underway
- `completed` — Spec generated successfully; artifacts ready
- `blocked` — Generation stalled on an error or governance gate; human review required
- `failed` — Spec generation failed permanently; may be retried

**Path parameters:**
- `jobId` (string, required): Job ID

**Request:**
```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "patch_id": "p_xyz789",
      "action": "accept",
      "resolved_content": null
    },
    {
      "patch_id": "p_xyz790",

## Document API — `/api/documents`

The document API manages spec documents directly. These are the same documents created by spec jobs.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/documents` | Create a new document |
| `GET` | `/api/documents/:docId` | Fetch document metadata and markdown |
| `PATCH` | `/api/documents/:docId` | Update document markdown or metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/documents/:docId/patches` | List patches for a document |
| `GET` | `/api/documents/:docId/export` | Export canonical spec bundle |
| `POST` | `/api/documents/:docId/export` | Export canonical spec bundle (alias) |

**Export blocking gate:** `GET /api/documents/:docId/export` returns `409 CLARIFICATIONS_REQUIRED` when unanswered critical clarifications exist. Pass `?force=true` to bypass.

Full document API reference is documented in the spec store (`lib/specforge/store.ts`).

---

## Clarification API

Clarifications are structured Q&A pairs anchored to specific sections of the spec. They are part of the depth-gate mechanism.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/documents/:docId/clarifications` | List all clarifications for a document |
| `POST` | `/api/documents/:docId/clarifications` | Create a new clarification |
| `PATCH` | `/api/documents/:docId/clarifications?clarification_id=:clarId` | Answer or resolve a clarification |

---

## Design Feedback API

### POST /api/documents/:id/design-feedback

Convert design reviewer feedback into a governed patch proposal targeting the UX Pack section.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "feedback": "string (1-2000 chars)",
  "section": "ux-pack | design-system | general"
}
```

`section` defaults to `"ux-pack"` when omitted.

**Response (201):**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "patch_id": "patch_...",
  "message": "Design feedback queued for review"
}
```

**Flow:** Feedback is converted to a patch proposal targeting the UX Pack block (or the first block as fallback), then queued in the decide stage where it can be accepted or rejected like any other patch. When `section` is `"general"`, a clarification record is also created.

---

## Section Iteration API

### POST /api/documents/:id/sections/:blockId/iterate

Run AI-assisted iteration on a specific document section. Produces a governed patch proposal targeting the specified block.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "string (1-2000 chars)",
  "actor_id": "string",
  "actor_type": "human | agent"
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "patch_id": "patch_...",
  "block_id": "blk_...",
  "proposed_content": "...",
  "tool": "claude_cli | heuristic"
}
```

**Flow:** Instruction + section content + doc context are injected as agent context. Claude CLI generates revised content (or heuristic fallback). A PatchProposal targeting the block is created and queued for review.

**Error responses:**
- `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` - Invalid request body
- `404` - Document or block not found
- `500 SECTION_ITERATE_FAILED` - Internal iteration error

---

## Depth Gates (Export Blocking)

`GET/POST /api/documents/:id/export` enforces depth gates unless `?force=true`.

**Gates:**

| Gate ID | Check |
|---------|-------|
| `PROBLEM_DEFINED` | Problem section exists and is substantive (>50 chars) |
| `GOALS_DEFINED` | Goals section has at least 1 goal item |
| `UX_PACK_PRESENT` | UX Pack section present (unless API-only or CLI-only scope) |
| `NO_OPEN_CRITICAL_CLARIFICATIONS` | No unanswered critical clarifications |
| `MIN_READINESS_SCORE` | Readiness score >= 50 |
| `TASKS_DEFINED` | Tasks section has at least 1 task item |

**On gate failure (422):**
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": { "message": "Export blocked: depth gates failed", "code": "DEPTH_GATES_FAILED" },
  "gates": [ { "id": "PROBLEM_DEFINED", "label": "...", "passed": false, "reason": "..." } ],
  "blockers": [ "Problem section content is too short (must be >50 chars)" ]
}
```

**Bypass:** `?force=true` proceeds with export and includes gate results as warnings in the response.

---

## Handoff API

### GET /api/documents/:id/handoff

Fetch the starter-bundle handoff for a document.

### POST /api/documents/:id/handoff

Emit the full handoff JSON with export bundle + planning stage provenance.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "documentId": "doc_...",
  "workspaceId": "ws_...",
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-26T...",
  "generatedBy": { "actor_type": "human", "actor_id": "..." },
  "planningSession": {
    "session_id": "ps_...",
    "stages": [
      { "name": "discovery", "status": "completed", "patch_id": "...", "outputs": {...} },
      { "name": "design-review", "status": "skipped", "patch_id": null, "outputs": null }
    ]
  },
  "exportBundle": { "prd": "...", "spec": "...", "tasks": "...", "agentSpec": "..." },
  "executionBrief": "...",
  "launchPacket": "..."
}
```

Conditionally includes `designSystem` when design-review is completed and `security` when security-review is completed.

---

## Job Status Values

| Status | Meaning | Next action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `queued` | Job created, waiting to be processed (assisted mode) or for human review | Submit patch decisions via `/review-decision` |
| `running` | Spec generation is active | Wait for completion or check status |
| `completed` | Spec generated successfully; artifacts are ready | Fetch artifacts via `/artifacts` |
| `blocked` | Generation hit an error or governance gate | Review blocker message; fix and retry via `/retry` |
| `failed` | Generation failed permanently | Retry via `/retry` with updated constraints |

---

## Error Response Format

All error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Validation failed: brief must be at least 1 character",
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED"
  }
}
```

**Common error codes:**
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` — Request body did not pass schema validation
- `JOB_NOT_FOUND` — Job ID does not exist
- `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND` — Document does not exist
- `NO_DOCUMENT` — Job was not yet assigned a document
- `SPEC_JOB_CREATE_FAILED` — Failed to create job
- `SPEC_JOB_GET_FAILED` — Failed to fetch job
- `SPEC_JOB_ARTIFACTS_FAILED` — Failed to build artifacts
- `REVIEW_DECISION_FAILED` — Failed to apply patch decisions
- `SPEC_JOB_RETRY_FAILED` — Failed to retry job

---

## Rate Limiting

Local development: No rate limiting.

Pilot deployment: Subject to workspace plan limits (e.g., assist quota, job concurrency).

---

## Collaboration Session Handshake

Documents edited in real-time use signed Hocuspocus room tokens. To join a collaborative session:

1. Call `POST /api/collab/session` to obtain a signed room token
2. Use the token to connect a WebSocket to `ws://localhost:4321/api/collab` with room name and token in the query

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/collab/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"document_id": "doc_abc", "user_id": "user_123"}'

# Response
{
  "token": "eyJ...",
  "room": "collab_doc_abc",
  "expires_at": "2025-02-01T13:34:56Z"
}
```

See `LOCAL_RUNBOOK.md` for collaboration debugging and reconnection handling.
