# SpecForge Web

Next.js application for the SpecForge MVP.

The current route split is:
- `/` marketing/overview landing page
- `/pricing` pricing page
- `/workspace` the actual working SpecForge product

Current slice:
- guided spec creation that generates the canonical draft from structured inputs
- shared OpenSpec core reuse for guided wizard and readiness logic
- mini agent-assist that can populate guided fields from a rough brief
- demo workspaces now enforce a small included assist quota while pilot workspaces remain effectively unbounded
- workspace member limits and a seat-based monthly billing preview now exist as the first SaaS billing/membership hooks
- pricing and plan JSON now share one workspace plan catalog instead of duplicating tier definitions
- pilot workspaces now require GitHub-linked member invites while local demo workspaces keep the lighter rehearsal flow
- local workspace sessions with GitHub OAuth pilot hooks for server-side attribution
- persisted workspace members with add/remove controls in the workspace session panel
- persisted workspace members can now update roles in-place from the workspace session panel
- workspace plan switcher for local demo vs pilot rehearsal
- local embedded SQL persistence via PGlite with disk-backed snapshot sharing across app workers
- hosted persistence path via Postgres-backed store selection
- guided drafts now include a first-class `Requirements` section so readiness can clear from the guided path
- document create/load API routes
- document update API route
- patch decision API route
- Tiptap-backed document workspace
- Yjs/Hocuspocus live room wiring per active document
- collaborator awareness chips and remote cursors in the shared editor
- signed collab session handshakes between the web app and Hocuspocus server
- versioned room replay with explicit stale-room detection and latest-snapshot reload
- patch proposal ingestion with stale detection
- patch acceptance/rejection/cherry-pick flow with audit trail
- anchored comment threads with resolve flow
- clarification queue with answer writeback into canonical markdown
- canonical `ideas/` showcase import for `server-management-agent`
- showcase walkthrough from imported idea to launch packet in the export stage
- block-level provenance markers in the shared canvas
- richer in-text attribution overlays alongside the shared canvas markers
- readiness scoring and recap panel
- deterministic export bundle preview
- starter handoff output for the minimum TypeScript starter plus constrained docs-only / Next.js templates
- execution brief and combined launch packet JSON
- in-product delivery-loop panel exposing backlog status and next-pass brief
- terminal-native `specforge` CLI now supports `init`, `status`, `context`, `artifacts`, `backups`, `backlog`, and a lightweight `tui`
- repo skill bundle now exists at `../skills/specforge/` so the same flow can be installed as an agent skill later
- local admin controls for resetting demo workspace data and seeding review activity
- staged UI for the local MVP flow
- web runtime health endpoint at `/api/health`
- web runtime metrics endpoint at `/api/metrics`
- workspace entitlements endpoint at `/api/workspace/entitlements`
- workspace billing endpoint at `/api/workspace/billing`
- workspace plans endpoint at `/api/workspace/plans`
- workspace ops summary endpoint at `/api/ops/summary`
- workspace incident feed endpoint at `/api/ops/incidents`
- workspace backup index endpoint at `/api/ops/backups`
- pricing anchors benchmarked in `../PRICING_BENCHMARKS.md`

## REST API Quickstart

SpecForge exposes a service API so external agents can submit briefs and receive fully-specified documents without a browser.

### Autonomous mode (hands-off)
```bash
# Submit a brief — SpecForge runs the full spec loop and returns artifacts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/service/spec-jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"brief": "A real-time collaborative spec editor", "mode": "autonomous"}'

# Returns: { "job": { "job_id": "...", "status": "completed" }, "document_id": "..." }

# Fetch the full artifact bundle (PRD, SPEC, TASKS, agent_spec.json)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/service/spec-jobs/{jobId}/artifacts
```

### Assisted mode (human-in-the-loop)
```bash
# Submit brief — job sits at "queued", waiting for human patch review
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/service/spec-jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"brief": "...", "mode": "assisted"}'

# Apply governance decisions when ready
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/service/spec-jobs/{jobId}/review-decision \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decisions": [{"patch_id": "...", "action": "accept"}]}'

# Retry after a blocked job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/service/spec-jobs/{jobId}/retry
```

See `../API_REFERENCE.md` for the full endpoint catalog.

## Notes

- The local runtime persists through a JSON snapshot under `.data/` and is seeded from `../fixtures/`.
- Hosted mode can switch to Postgres with `SPECFORGE_PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=postgres` and `DATABASE_URL=...`.
- The containerized runtime now uses Postgres by default and still seeds from `/fixtures`.
- The collaboration runtime lives in `../collab-server/`.
- `docker compose up --build` brings up web, collab, and postgres with health checks plus a shared collab secret for deployment rehearsal.
- The web client connects to `NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLAB_URL` and defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:4321`.
- The collab handshake is signed by `POST /api/collab/session`; override `SPECFORGE_COLLAB_SECRET` only if both the web app and collab server share it.
- The final handoff stage exposes `/export`, `/handoff`, `/execution`, and `/launch-packet` routes for downstream build agents.
- The app also exposes `/api/parity/status` and `/api/parity/brief` so the backlog driver is visible inside the product, not only from the CLI.
- The local parity runner lives at `../tools/specforge-parity-runner.mjs` and can drive bounded `codex exec` passes from the remaining backlog.
- The runner is designed to land a runnable minimum extensible product first, then keep advancing toward scoped parity without repeated manual re-prompting.
- `bun run parity:run:batch` runs a bounded multi-pass loop (`--until-clear --max-passes 3 --review-every 2`) so the backlog can advance without an unbounded nested session.
- In local demo mode, the `Local admin` panel can reset workspace documents and seed mock review activity for fast MVP testing.
- In local mode, agent assist can reuse existing `codex` or `claude` CLI logins from the server runtime, and the preferred runtime can be saved from the workspace session panel. Hosted mode should use server-side workspace credentials instead.
- Shared specs use canonical workspace URLs like `/workspace?document=<id>&stage=draft`; the workspace UI exposes a copyable share link, but pilot recipients still need GitHub sign-in and workspace membership.
- Local ops rehearsal now has both `bun run state:backup` and `bun run state:restore`, and the workspace sidebar links to the health and metrics endpoints directly.
- The workspace sidebar now also links to `/api/workspace/entitlements` and `/api/ops/summary` so local SaaS rehearsal can inspect quotas, billing preview, parity state, and persistence in one place.
- `/api/workspace/plans` now exposes the shared plan catalog that also drives `/pricing`, which makes packaging and billing-preview review easier.
- `/api/workspace/billing` now exposes upgrade-required reasons, recommended plan, and the current billing preview as a cleaner entitlement handoff for future payment integration.
- `/api/metrics`, `/api/ops/summary`, and the workspace sidebar now surface a simple design-partner funnel across activation, assist usage, collaboration, review, and launch preparation.
- `/api/ops/incidents` now exposes the current warning set for the active workspace so local hosted-ops rehearsal has a clearer incident-style surface.
- `/api/ops/summary` now includes basic warning alerts for missing backups, missing verification, and upgrade-required pressure so local hosted-ops rehearsal is easier to review.
- The workspace session panel can switch the active workspace plan between `demo` and `pilot` locally, which makes quota and billing-preview testing much faster.
- `bun run verify` is the canonical full local gate, and `specforge verify` exposes the same suite from the agent-native CLI surface.
- `bun run parity:verify` records the latest verification result into the runner state and handoff artifacts, so the orchestration loop has a durable last-known-green checkpoint.
- `bun run test:e2e` only runs the browser demo suite (`tests/demo.spec.ts`); engine-level acceptance coverage lives under `bun run test:acceptance`.
- The runner also schedules periodic multipass review/refactor passes so the loop compacts context, refreshes handoff state, and records meta learnings.
