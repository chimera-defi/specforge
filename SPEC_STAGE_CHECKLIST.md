## Readiness Note
The checklist above tracks presence of spec-stage assets, not proof that a runnable implementation already exists. Assets like `FIRST_60_MINUTES.md` and `ACCEPTANCE_TEST_MATRIX.md` currently define target implementation behavior.

## Depth Standard
1. Must include explicit execution outcome metric.
2. Must include retention and trust signals.
3. Must include phased rollout and scope cuts.
4. Must include adversarial and kill criteria.
5. Must include UX primary path + failure path coverage.
6. Must include guided clarification ("ask user") path for ambiguous sections.
7. Must include contract, fixture, and acceptance test linkage for one-shot builds.
