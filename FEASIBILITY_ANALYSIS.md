## Feasibility Analysis (SpecForge)

### Technical Feasibility
**Verdict:** Feasible with existing realtime collaboration and AI patching patterns.

1. Realtime editing: proven with CRDT/OT frameworks.
2. Agent patch proposals: straightforward with structured diff format.
3. Governed block/section merge controls: feasible but UX-sensitive.
4. Repo scaffolding: feasible with template engines and Git provider APIs.

### Key Hard Parts
1. Merge UX under concurrent human + agent edits.
2. Trust calibration for agent suggestions (quality/provenance).
3. Retention beyond novelty against entrenched docs tools.
4. Maintaining simplicity while adding execution features.

### Operational Feasibility
1. Startup/eng-team wedge is reachable via design partnerships.
2. Integrations (GitHub/Jira/Linear) increase complexity but are manageable in phases.

### Recommendation
Start with strong editing + patch review + depth-gate core, then ship repo generation only after trust, retention, and quality metrics are strong.
