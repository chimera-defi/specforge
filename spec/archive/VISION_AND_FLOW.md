## Vision and Stepwise Product Flow

## Vision
Help teams build better software rapidly by turning governed collaborative specs into execution-ready assets, with curated repo generation only after authoring behavior is proven.

## Stepwise Flow (Human + Agent)
1. **Collaborate on spec**
   - Team and agents co-edit PRD/spec in real time.
2. **Converge on decisions**
   - Resolve open questions and approve governed block-level patches.
3. **Run depth checks**
   - Assistant verifies required artifacts and asks targeted continuation questions where detail is missing.
4. **Generate iteration recap**
   - Assistant summarizes current thesis, what changed, open decisions, and go/no-go posture.
5. **Generate execution bundle**
   - Produce tasks, acceptance criteria, API/data model artifacts.
6. **Optionally generate curated example repository**
   - Create a scaffold from approved spec bundle using the constrained template family.
7. **Developer takeover**
   - Engineers continue in repo with traceability back to spec sections.

## UX Journey (MVP to Phase 2)
### MVP
1. Multiplayer markdown + comments + agent patches.
2. Structured exports (`PRD.md`, `SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, `agent_spec.json`).
3. Required depth-gate and recap checkpoints before milestone close.

### Phase 2
1. "Create Repo" from approved spec for curated examples.
2. One constrained TypeScript template family in the first repo-generation phase.
3. Link generated issues/PR checklists to originating spec sections.

## Why This Matters
The core value is not just writing docs together. It is reducing "spec-to-first-commit" time with controlled AI assistance.
