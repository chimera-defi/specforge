# SpecForge Implementation Tasks

## Current Status
- [x] Scoped MVP/spec parity for the build branch is reached.
- [x] Guided spec creation, shared authoring, governed patch review, comments, clarifications, readiness, export, starter handoff, execution brief, and launch packet are working.
- [x] Guided specs now include a first-class `UX Pack` section so UI/UX design is explicit before handoff.
- [x] Export stage now includes a real `Design handoff` panel built from the canonical UX Pack plus any completed design-review outputs.
- [x] POST /documents/:id/design-feedback — design feedback converted to governed patch proposal.
- [x] DesignHandoffPanel interactive feedback submission with section selector.
- [x] Design feedback loop: spec -> design review -> patch -> decide -> re-export.
- [x] Local MVP verification is green: lint, unit, build, acceptance, browser, contracts.
- [x] Hosted-runtime rehearsal exists with `web`, `collab-server`, and `postgres`.
- [x] The original scoped MVP backlog is clear; the remaining list below is broader post-parity SaaS/platform work.
- [x] Landing page at `/`, pricing page at `/pricing`, and product workspace at `/workspace` are live.

## Current Priority Order

- [ ] 1. Package the working local product.
  - Focus: Tauri shell, local runtime status, local install/download flow, local CLI assist diagnostics
- [ ] 2. Tighten the local alpha UX.
  - Focus: pilot membership polish, acceptance test UX, design review polish, remaining decomposition
- [ ] 3. Add honest SaaS scaffolding.
  - Focus: Stripe skeleton, entitlements cleanup, hosted ops surfaces
- [ ] 4. Prepare the hybrid hosted + local bridge model.
  - Focus: bridge spike, diagnostics export
- [ ] 5. Improve SpecForge itself as the future `ideas/` generator.
  - Focus: stronger guided fields, stronger idea scaffold, better one-shot export packs

## Shipped Surface
- [x] Guided spec wizard writes into the canonical document.
- [x] Shared OpenSpec core now owns guided wizard defaults/markdown builders plus shared readiness logic.
- [x] Readiness now expects `UX Pack` alongside the core problem/goals/requirements/tasks sections.
- [x] Shared OpenSpec core now also owns export bundle, execution-brief, and launch-packet builders.
- [x] Shared OpenSpec core now also owns starter template definitions and the curated TypeScript starter builder.
- [x] Mini agent-assist can populate guided fields from a rough brief, using local CLI tooling when available and a safe fallback otherwise.
- [x] Terminal-native `specforge` CLI can generate the same guided markdown/metadata as the web flow.
- [x] Terminal-native `specforge` CLI can also surface current backlog status/context for terminal-native operators.
- [x] Terminal-native `specforge` CLI can surface the latest runner handoff and meta-learning artifacts for terminal-native review.
- [x] Terminal-native `specforge` CLI can surface local backup manifests for terminal-native ops review.
- [x] `/specforge` slash-command style invocations now work for both guided creation and status-style commands.
- [x] `specforge tui` now provides a lightweight interactive terminal surface for guided init, status, context, and backlog review.
- [x] A repo-packaged `skills/specforge/` bundle now exists so the same guided flow can be installed as an agent skill later.
- [x] Tiptap + Yjs + Hocuspocus multiplayer canvas with shared presence.
- [x] Governed patch queue with accept/reject/cherry-pick.
- [x] Anchored comments and clarification writeback.
- [x] Inline provenance plus audit trail.
- [x] Deterministic export bundle, starter handoff, execution brief, and launch packet.
- [x] Canonical `ideas/` showcase import for `server-management-agent`.
- [x] Local admin controls for reset/seed testing.
- [x] GitHub OAuth hooks, secure-cookie/secret enforcement, and server-derived collab identity.
- [x] Workspace membership is now persisted and manageable from the workspace UI instead of living only in static seed data.
- [x] Postgres-backed hosted persistence option plus health/metrics endpoints.
- [x] Local backup snapshot script exists for web state, collab state, and runner artifacts.
- [x] Metrics endpoint now exposes simple workspace funnel counts for design-partner instrumentation.
- [x] Workspace usage events now exist for assist, handoff, execution, and launch-packet views as a billing/metering skeleton.
- [x] Demo workspaces now enforce a first assist-usage quota so pricing and plan tiers have one real entitlement path in product code.
- [x] Workspace membership limits and a seat-based monthly billing preview now exist so future SaaS billing/membership flows have real product hooks.
- [x] Workspace entitlements and ops summary endpoints now exist for local rehearsal and future hosted ops surfaces.
- [x] Workspace plans can now be switched in-product for local quota and billing rehearsal, and local backups are inspectable through an ops endpoint.
- [x] Shared workspace plan definitions now drive both the pricing page and `/api/workspace/plans`, so SaaS packaging surfaces use one contract.
- [x] Workspace entitlements now expose feature flags alongside quotas and billing preview, so SaaS packaging has a clearer contract surface.
- [x] Workspace behavior signals now track member adds, plan changes, assist preference saves, document creation, patch decisions, and clarification answers.
- [x] Workspace member creation now blocks duplicate GitHub logins instead of silently creating conflicting pilot memberships.
- [x] Pilot workspaces now require GitHub-linked member invites, while the workspace UI exposes clearer local-vs-pilot invite guidance.
- [x] Workspace membership is no longer add-only: the workspace UI can remove members safely without deleting the current active session or the final remaining member.
- [x] Workspace membership roles can now be updated directly from the workspace UI, and those changes flow into workspace behavior instrumentation.
- [x] Metrics, ops summary, and the workspace UI now expose a simple design-partner funnel: activation, assist usage, collaboration, review, and launch preparation.
- [x] Workspace incident warnings now have a dedicated `/api/ops/incidents` surface instead of living only inside the broader ops summary payload.
- [x] Agent service job workflow: POST/GET spec-jobs, per-job status/artifacts/retry/review-decision endpoints, autonomous and assisted modes.
- [x] Export clarification blocking gate: unanswered critical clarifications return 409 CLARIFICATIONS_REQUIRED; bypass with `?force=true`.
- [x] Delivery loop with intents, claims, context, handoff artifact, and meta-learnings.
- [x] Section-level iteration endpoint: `POST /documents/:id/sections/:blockId/iterate` wires `iterate.ts` into API route.
- [x] Depth gates logic: `evaluateDepthGates()` in `readiness.ts` with 6 gates enforced on export (bypass: `?force=true`).
- [x] POST /documents/:id/handoff endpoint: full handoff JSON with planning provenance + conditional designSystem/security.
- [x] ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md updated: Decisions 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31 reflect current implementation status.
- [x] Shared orchestrator backlog parsing now feeds both the parity runner and the in-product delivery-loop panel.
- [x] Runner status/brief/context now stay aligned with the live backlog instead of stale historical intents.
- [x] Desktop packaging direction is now documented: Tauri shell + supervised local sidecars + future hosted/local bridge split.

## Meta Learnings To Keep Applying
- [x] Treat placeholder fallback content as real product debt and remove it during review passes.
- [x] Keep pricing, plans, and entitlements on one shared contract surface.
- [x] Keep the design contract explicit too: if a product has a user-facing surface, require a UX Pack or an explicit `API-only` / `CLI-only` note.
- [x] Split large UI routes into panel components before they become unreadable.
- [x] Split persistence by domain before store changes become high-risk.
- [x] Run the final verification gate sequentially to avoid fake Playwright or collab port regressions.
- [x] Desktop packaging should wrap the existing working local architecture before trying to collapse it into a single runtime.
- [x] Split MVP parity from broader platform/company parity so “done” never hides unfinished productization work.
- [x] Require explicit runtime topology and distribution mode in specs before implementation starts.
- [x] Require acceptance tests and release-stage targets in the spec itself, not only in later implementation docs.

## Spec System Improvements
