# SpecForge Local Runbook

## Scope
- Local demo recovery for the SpecForge web app, collab server, Postgres-backed deployment rehearsal, and parity runner.
- Lightweight observability for room auth, room load/store, request tracing, and reconnect flows.

## Primary Commands
```bash
cd web
bun run dev
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run build
bun run test:e2e

cd ../collab-server
bun run dev

cd ..
docker compose up --build
bun run state:backup
bun run state:restore
```

## Deployment Rehearsal Notes
- `docker-compose.yml` now starts `specforge-web`, `specforge-collab`, and `specforge-postgres`.
- The web image now ships `fixtures/` at `/fixtures`, which matches `SPECFORGE_FIXTURES_DIR` in the compose and production env examples.
- The compose rehearsal also pins a shared `SPECFORGE_COLLAB_SECRET` so web-issued room tokens and collab auth stay aligned.
- The web service defaults to `SPECFORGE_PERSISTENCE_BACKEND=postgres` in compose, so hosted persistence is exercised locally too.

## Runtime Signals
- Web app: editor toolbar status chip shows `connecting`, `live`, `saving`, `recovering`, `offline`, `stale`, or `error`.
- Collab server: structured JSON logs for `server_listen`, `auth_ok`, `auth_failed`, `room_load`, `room_store`, `client_connected`, and `client_disconnected`.
- Health endpoints:
  - web app: `GET /api/health`
  - web metrics: `GET /api/metrics`
  - workspace ops summary: `GET /api/ops/summary`
  - workspace incidents: `GET /api/ops/incidents`
  - workspace entitlements: `GET /api/workspace/entitlements`
  - collab server: `GET http://127.0.0.1:4322/health`
  - collab metrics: `GET http://127.0.0.1:4322/metrics`
- Persistence:
  - app state snapshot under `web/.data/`
  - room snapshots under `collab-server/.data/collab-rooms/`
  - hosted overrides:
    - `SPECFORGE_PERSISTENCE_BACKEND`
    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `SPECFORGE_DB_PATH`
    - `SPECFORGE_COLLAB_STORE_DIR`

## Failure Modes

### Collab room auth fails
- Symptom: editor banner shows auth/error state and the room never becomes live.
- Check:
  - web route `POST /api/collab/session`
  - `SPECFORGE_COLLAB_SECRET` matches between web and collab-server shells if overridden
  - collab server log event `auth_failed`
- Recovery:
  - restart `web` and `collab-server`
  - click `Reconnect room`

### Room goes stale after another save
- Symptom: banner says a newer snapshot is available.
- Check:
  - `GET /api/documents/:id` returns a higher version than the open workspace
- Recovery:
  - click `Reload latest snapshot`
  - verify version increment in the toolbar message

### Offline / reconnect
- Symptom: banner says `Offline` or `Reconnecting room`.
- Recovery:
  - restore network or restart the local collab server
  - click `Reconnect room`
  - confirm toolbar returns to `live`

### Snapshot drift between app workers
- Symptom: page reload shows old document state.
- Check:
  - `web/.data/` exists and is writable
  - latest save created a new snapshot timestamp
- Recovery:
  - save again from the draft stage
  - refresh the page

## Observability Notes
- Use collab server JSON logs as the first debugging surface.
- Use `x-specforge-request-id` from responses to correlate web requests with structured web logs.
- Hit the health endpoints before deeper debugging to distinguish startup issues from document-sync issues.
- Both health endpoints now expose the active persistence configuration, which is the first place to check for mounted-volume drift.
- Metrics endpoints expose workspace/document counts and room snapshot counts for quick runtime sanity checks.
- Use Playwright `bun run test:e2e` as the local integration smoke test after fixes.
- Treat the launch packet as the final parity artifact: if export/handoff/execution diverge, rebuild the launch context first.
- `bun run state:backup` snapshots local web state, collab state, and runner artifacts under `.backups/specforge/`.
- `bun run state:restore` restores the latest snapshot by default, or a specific backup path if passed as an argument.
- `GET /api/ops/backups` lists the latest local backup manifests so restore targets are visible from the app side too.
- `GET /api/ops/incidents` exposes the active warning set for the current workspace, which is the quickest way to see upgrade pressure, missing backups, or missing verification before digging through the full ops summary.
